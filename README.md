# p5-Snake
Simple "snake" game writtin in javascript using P5js

plan (may or may not get this far!) is to adapt this for play by wire for testing various game AI approaches to learn more about those and how to link them into different games.

Still a bit on the raw side - download and launch the index.html to play (downloads the P5 components from CDN rather than embedded locally)

- Space to start the game
- Cursor keys to change direction
- 'D' toggles debug info
